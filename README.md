## Technologies Used

- Open Food Facts API
- Axios for API calls

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

## Challenges I Faced (And Fixed!)
1.Problem: Categories weren't filtering right
  Solution: Found the perfect API endpoint after some tasty debugging

2.Problem: Mobile view was messy
  Solution: Redesigned the layout to be more flexible

3.Problem: Search felt slow
  Solution: Added a slight delay before searching (debouncing)

## What's Next?
I'm thinking about adding:
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorite products feature
- üìä Better nutrition visuals
